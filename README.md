# The haspe project

Haspe is a project for a better education platform, made by students for students (and people).

Haspe includes moonlight, a playful and efficient way to learn anything.


## The project organisation

This is the presentation part of haspe, not the webapp. It will be deployed on netlify.

Main libraries:
- [React, ReactDOM](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

All the source files **must** be in the `/src` directory.

The project uses [gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org/) to be compiled. 
Please do **not** touch the `gatsby-*.js` files.
